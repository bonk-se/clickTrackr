clickTrackr
===========

Bonk clickTrackr is a simple javascript that can track and log a visitors
clicks on your site and generate heatmaps over the tracked pages. It can be
configured to track all clicks or just the last click the visitors does before
leaving the page.

Full documentation can be found @ http://bonk.se/clickTrackr


**Setup**

Put the compressed version of clickTrackr.js where you want it and include the
following in the footer of the page you want to track:

<script type="text/javascript" src="/PATH/TO/clickTrackr.js"></script>
<script type="text/javascript">
bCT.init();
</script>

Create the database tables required by running the queries in setup/db-setup.sql.
Put the PHP-files at /clickTrackr/log.php on your server (no changes needed in 
clickTrackr.js then) and modify config.php to your liking.


**Usage**

bCT.init({ all, freq, refId, log, url, maxX, maxY });
